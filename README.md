<h1>Introduction</h1>

Some simple activities when I started learning Javascript.

<h1>1. Quizz </h1>
<p>A simple Quizz game where the user have to guess a number between 1 and 100 in 6 tries.</p>
  
<h1>2. Contacts </h1>
<p> A simple Contact Manager where you can:
  <li>
    <ul>Display the saved contacts</ul>
    <ul>Add a new contact</ul>
    <ul>Exit the Contact Manager</ul>
  </li>
</p>
